# Event Sourcing Kotlin Toolkit

This project aims to provide a toolkit to work with event sourcing, as well as some related architectural patterns such as CQRS and DDD, written 100% in Kotlin.

We aim to support all Kotlin targets relevant for server-side development, such as Kotlin/JVM, Kotlin/Native (Linux and macOS, arm64 and amd64) and Kotlin/JS.

A more detailed documentation and possibly a long-term roadmap coming soon :)
